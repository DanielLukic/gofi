1. Write small functions:
  - Aim for 10-15 lines per function.
  - Less than 10 whenever possible.
  - Hard limit at 30 lines.
2. Use snake_case consistently for everything:
  - Use snake_case for functions and variables.
  - Use snake_case for struct fields and methods.
  - Allow exceptions when Go requires PascalCase etc.
