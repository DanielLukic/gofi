1. Write small functions:
  - Aim for 10-15 lines per function.
  - Less than 10 whenever possible.
  - Hard limit at 30 lines.
2. Use snake_case consistently for everything:
  - Use snake_case for functions and variables.
  - Use snake_case for struct fields and methods.
  - Allow exceptions when Go requires PascalCase etc. [GOLANG ONLY]
3. Work in small commit steps:
  - Separate refactor and implement steps.
  - Commit every step.
4. For essential parts write tests:
  - a. Write a test first that captures the functionality you want to implement.
  - b. Then implement the change.
  - d. As long as test fails, refactor/fix as necessary. Until green.
  - c. If test is green, commit.
5. Use logging:
  - Use logging instead of print statements.
  - Use the logging module.
